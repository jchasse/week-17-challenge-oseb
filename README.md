# Week 17 Challenge


## React Todo App


### Project Instructions

In this challenge we will create a Todo list application using React.

This application will have three components:
- App
- TodoForm
- Todos

To complete this challenge you will practice working with the following concepts:
- Components
- Props
- State
- Events
- Forms
- Callback Functions

The skeleton of each component has been set up for you but you will need to implement the functionality outlined below.  

## App Component

The App component should be your top level component. It will be responsible for rendering the TodoForm and the Todos components.  It will also be responsible for keeping track of all the todos.

## TodoForm Component

The TodoForm component should render the form to create a new todo item.  Each todo should have a `title` and a `content`. On form submittal, the todo item needs to be stored in the App component.

## Todos Component

The Todos component should iterate over all of the todo items and render the `title` and `content` of each todo item.

## Getting Started

To start install the necessary packages, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` to start the application.
